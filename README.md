# Stock-and-freight-management-app
This is an app which can be used in shipping companies to help with their stock and freight management.

## Introduction
I am currently studying online for two years and a half due to the strict COVID control in China.
It is a tough time (I guess you feel that too) and one of the problems we face is getting Chinese textbooks for our lectures.
We usually buy the textbooks from Alibaba Taobao and it also provides shipping option.
However, the cost is quite high and we have to seek for third-party shipping company.

At that time, my SQL course required us to build a project tackling some databases. And that's what made this project happen.
We chose a shipping company website that we frequently use for our shipping needs and figured out the process underneath from a client's perspective.
We managed to develop and imitate some of the functions the website provides, and gave the app some nice look (Heads off to people who learns designs).

## Skillset
We Used Python Kivy and KivyMD module for front-end development, Python as back-end language, and SQL Server as database.

Developed a few functions:
1) Login (for both clients' and workers' side)
2) Create user accounts
3) Information display (including user information, price information, parcel information, etc)
4) Key in parcels
5) Create an order
6) Collect parcels in an order
7) Shipping fee calculation
