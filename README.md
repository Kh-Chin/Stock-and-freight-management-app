# Stock-and-freight-management-app
This is an app which can be used in shipping companies to help with their stock and freight management.

## Introduction
I studied in Harbin Institute of Technology, China. When I was studying online due to COVID, one of the problems I faced was getting Chinese textbooks for our lectures.
We usually bought the textbooks from Alibaba Taobao and sought for third-party shipping company for overseas logistics.

So, when my SQL course required us to build a project, we chose a shipping company website that we frequently use and figured out the process underneath from a client's perspective. We managed to develop and imitate some functions of the website, including front-end, back-end and database, and designed the app layout by ourselves.

## Skillset
We used Python Kivy and KivyMD module for front-end development, Python as back-end language, and SQL Server as database.

We Developed a few functions:
1) Login (for both clients' and workers' side)
2) Creating user accounts
3) Information display (including user information, price information, parcel information, etc)
4) Parcels information entry
5) Creating an order
6) Collecting parcels in an order
7) Shipping fee calculation
